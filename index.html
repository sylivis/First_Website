            <p>I hope you like the background. It was a picture taken in some of the southern-most mountains 
                of New Mexico, right outside of Alamagordo. I was actually sitting here a month ago when I decided
                to take this course. I  was staying with family, as my 
                 father had just passed. We gathered for the funeral the 
                 morning in which this picture had been taken. The decision I made to attend this boot camp stems 
                 from a desire to move back to that small town and be surrounded again by family. I hope to work remotely there once I have 
                 graduated, provided that I find work.
            </p>
            <p>I had learned some coding off and on over the past few years. I had even taken Computer Science 101
                 when I was still in college. I know the basics of JavaScript, some Krotlin, and now, after 
                 completing the prework, some Python, though nowhere near enough of any of it. The logic I have
                  come across while coding always makes sense, and I have yet to come across a problem that 
                  I believe I would be unable to solve <span>eventually</span> More importantly, the more I learn about development,
                   the more I want to know. I have yet to find any practical skill I enjoy more than programing. I look forward 
                   to learning what I can while in this course.
            </p>
            <p>Feel free to browse the website. I assume you are to grade its merit afterall. If the mood suits you, 
                you can even <a id=”addplacement” href=”https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bailyleary”> buy me a cup of coffee.<a> This boot camp was expensive 
                    after all!

            <p>By the way, I made the bot margin extra long, so you may enjoy the view.</p>
